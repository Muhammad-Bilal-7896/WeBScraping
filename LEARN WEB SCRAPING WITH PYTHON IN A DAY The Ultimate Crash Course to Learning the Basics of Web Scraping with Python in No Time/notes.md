### "Web scraping is the process of using an automated system to extract useful information from a website which was not necessarily designed to be simple for machines to navigate".

## Why use Web Scraping?
### The general answer to this question is this: 
-  web scraping is used any time that you need a machine to have access to information which is available on the web but which has not been presented in a way which is easily accessible to machines. There are a few reasons that data on the web might not be presented in a machine-friendly way. Probably the most common reason is that the 
-  owners of the data (i.e. the people who have put the data online) simply did not expect or intend the data to be read by a computer program. For example, Wikipedia is a fantastic source of all kinds of information but the HTML generated for Wikipedia article pages are (as I write this) not always machine-friendly. Another reason that a webpage may not be machine-friendly is that the 
-  owners of the data has some specific reason that they do not want programs to read their site.
